📌 Project Overview
Your project bridges the communication gap between deaf/mute individuals and those unfamiliar with sign language. It does so by:
✔ Recognizing hand signs in real-time using Mediapipe
✔ Converting detected hand signs into speech (Hand Sign to Audio)
✔ Converting spoken words into corresponding hand signs (Audio to Hand Sign)
✔ Forming complete sentences from multiple detected hand signs
✔ Optimizing gesture speed adaptation for smoother recognition

✅ Features You Have Implemented


1️⃣ Hand Sign to Audio Conversion
Uses Mediapipe for real-time hand keypoint detection
Classifies the detected hand gesture into pre-trained hand signs
Speaks out the detected hand sign using pyttsx3
Implements sentence formation to make communication more natural
Allows manual control over announcements (toggle ON/OFF using a key).

2️⃣ Audio to Hand Sign Conversion
Uses SpeechRecognition (Google API/Vosk) to recognize spoken words
Matches the recognized words with a predefined dictionary of hand signs
Displays the corresponding hand sign images using Tkinter (GUI).

3️⃣ Gesture Speed Adaptation
Tracks hand movement speed to adjust confidence thresholds dynamically
Prevents false positives when the hand is moving too fast or too slow

4️⃣ Sentence Formation
Groups multiple detected hand signs into coherent sentences
Implements manual sentence stopping (pressing a key to finalize a sentence)
Allows clearing the buffer to avoid unintended hand signs being added

5️⃣ Optimizations for Realism
Confidence thresholding prevents misclassification of hand signs
Frame rate improvements for smoother detection in OpenCV
Manual toggle (A key) for enabling/disabling announcements

📌 Next Steps & Improvements
🔹 Running the project on Google Colab (for GPU acceleration)
🔹 Expanding the sign language vocabulary (e.g., adding ASL gestures)
🔹 Improving accuracy with custom-trained hand sign models
🔹 Enhancing GUI for better user interaction (e.g., making Tkinter more interactive)
🔹 Adding support for multiple languages in speech-to-sign conversion
