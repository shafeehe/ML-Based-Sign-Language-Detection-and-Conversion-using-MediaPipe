# ML-Based-Sign-Language-Detection-and-Conversion-using-MediaPipe
ML based Sign Language Detection and Conversion System for Deaf and Mute Individuals using Google's MediaPipe Framework.

This project aims to develop an integrated system using MediaPipe for realtime
detection and recognition of sign language to assist mute individuals and an
audio-to-sign language conversion system to aid deaf individuals. The sign language
detection system will leverage MediaPipe’s advanced hand-tracking capabilities to
interpret sign language gestures, providing instant audio announcements for effective
communication. Additionally, the audio-to-sign language conversion system
will translate spoken words into visual sign language, displayed on a screen to facilitate
understanding for deaf users. This project focuses on creating an accurate,
efficient, and user-friendly solution that bridges the communication gap for mute and
deaf individuals, enhancing their ability to interact seamlessly in various social and
professional settings.

While traditional solutions such as sign language interpreters offer some support,
they are not always accessible or feasible in every setting. Advances in machine
learning, computer vision, and hand-tracking technologies present new opportunities
to bridge this communication gap. In particular, MediaPipe, an open-source framework
developed by Google, provides robust hand-tracking capabilities crucial for
interpreting sign language gestures. This project leverages MediaPipe’s technology
to create a real-time system that enables two-way communication: it translates sign
language gestures into spoken language for mute individuals and converts audio into
visual sign language for deaf individuals. By integrating these functionalities, the
project aims to promote inclusivity, providing a practical solution that facilitates
communication between hearing, mute, and deaf individuals. This system is designed
to be accessible on various devices, making it scalable and adaptable to a
wide range of environments.
